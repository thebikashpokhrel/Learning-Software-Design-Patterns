## Design Principle

> **Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.**

Allow classes to be easily extended to incorporate new behavior without modifying existing code. What do we get if we accomplish this? Designs that are resilient to change and flexible enough to take on new functionality to meet changing requirements.
