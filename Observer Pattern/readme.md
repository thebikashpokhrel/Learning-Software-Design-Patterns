## Understanding the Observer Pattern

1. **Definition**:
   The Observer pattern establishes a one-to-many relationship between objects. In this pattern, a subject (also known as Observable) maintains a list of observers and notifies them automatically of any state changes.

2. **Interfaces**:

   - **Subject (Observable)**: This interface allows observers to register and unregister themselves. It also provides a method to notify all registered observers of any state changes.
   - **Observer**: Observers use this interface to receive updates from the subject. Each observer needs to implement the update method to handle state changes.

3. **Loose Coupling**:
   Observers and subjects are loosely coupled. The Observable (Subject) only knows that observers implement the Observer interface and does not need to know the concrete details of the observers. This decoupling enhances flexibility and maintainability.

4. **Push vs. Pull**:
   The pattern supports both push and pull mechanisms for data retrieval. In this implementation, a pull mechanism (where observers pull the data from the subject) is preferred, but the provided code uses a push mechanism where the subject pushes data to observers.

## Design Principle

The Observer pattern adheres to the design principle of striving for loosely coupled designs between interacting objects. This principle enhances flexibility and reduces the impact of changes in one part of the system on other parts.

## Code Implementation

The code demonstrates the Observer pattern by modeling a weather station system with the following components:

1. **Observer Interface (`IObserver`)**:
   Defines the `update` method that observers use to receive updates from the subject.

2. **Subject Interface (`ISubject`)**:
   Defines methods for registering, removing, and notifying observers.

3. **Display Element Interface (`IDisplayElement`)**:
   Defines the `display` method for classes that need to present data.

4. **Concrete Classes**:
   - `WeatherData`: Implements the `ISubject` interface and maintains the state of weather measurements. It notifies all registered observers of state changes.
   - `currentCondtionsDisplay`: Implements both `IObserver` and `IDisplayElement`. It displays current weather conditions.
   - `heatIndexDisplay`: Implements both `IObserver` and `IDisplayElement`. It calculates and displays the heat index based on temperature and humidity.

### Example Usage

The main function in the code demonstrates the usage of the Observer pattern:

- Creates a `WeatherData` object.
- Creates two display objects (`currentCondtionsDisplay` and `heatIndexDisplay`) and registers them with the `WeatherData` object.
- Sets new weather measurements which trigger automatic notifications to the observers, updating and displaying the data.
